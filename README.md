### Naive Algorithm

The source file maximum_pairwise_product.py contains an implementation of a naive algorithm that just goes through all possible pairs. While it is clearly correct, it is too slow

### Fast Algorithm

See the materials of the first week at Coursera or edX to implement a faster algorithm as max_pairwise_product function.
